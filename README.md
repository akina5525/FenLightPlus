I'm jokingly called this FenLight+. There was always 1 thing I wished Fen could do that it couldn't and that was delete RD Cloud files from the results screen so that I didn't have to go into My Services everytime I accidently added a bad package to the cloud. Now it can. 

This is the first Kodi addon I've ever edited so Tikipeter would probably shed a tear at how I butchered his code. I might keep working to improve this, I might not.

<h2>To Update From FenLight</h2>

In Kodi, go to Addons, open Fen Light -> Tools -> Settings -> General -> scroll down to 'Manage Addon Updates' and change these two fields:

<b>Github Username:</b> thejason40<br />
<b>Github Repo Address:</b> thejason40.github.io

Now go back to the Tools menu, and select Update Utilities -> Check For Updates

<h2>To Install Fresh</h2>

Go to Kodi -> File Manager -> Add Source -> add

`https://thejason40.github.io/packages`

call it "FenPlus"

Then go to Kodi -> Settings -> Add Ons -> Install from Zip -> FenPlus -> Install FenLight+ 2.0.08.
