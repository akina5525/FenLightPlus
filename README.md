`2.0.03` is the latest and last release of Fen Light.

For the love of God, please don't open any issues for bugs for this release. I need this thing finished with.

Thank you.



I didnt have time to sync with the last   `2.0.07` version before Tiki removed fen light.

You will need cocoscrapers module for external scrapers


Go to Kodi -> File Manager -> Add Source -> add
