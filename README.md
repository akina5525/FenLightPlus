`2.0.07` is the latest and last release of Fen Light.

For the love of God, please don't open any issues for bugs for this release. I need this thing finished with.

Thank you.



I have the final version of fen  `2.0.07` version before Tiki removed the repo. 
You can install this version (which works with Torbox and Real Debrid) 

You will need cocoscrapers module for external scrapers
